<body>
Shopping cart requirements. User should be able to:
<ul>
	<li>...add items with quantity.</li>
	<li>...mark items as acquired. When so marked, item will grey out or otherwise indicate new status.</li>
	<li>...change items in the list. Assume each item stays within a text input field for easy changes (don't require an "edit" mode).</li>
	<li>...remove items from list. When removed, the most recent removed item will appear in a list called "Last Removed" where the user can undo the removal.</li>
	<li>...make notes in a text field for general comments related to the list.</li>
</ul>
Stretch: allow for bookmarked or "regular" items
<ul>
	<li>Have a "bookmark" option next to each item in the main list. When clicked, add to the bookmark list. Possibly change the color or otherwise indicate the item is on the bookmark list.</li>
	<li>Button that opens the bookmarked items</li>
	<li>Bookmarked items allow adding to current list or removal from bookmarks.</li>
	<li>Have an "add all items to list" option for easy and quick shopping list initialization (which is *not* a word a regular user would use).</li>
</ul>
